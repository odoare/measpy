measpy is a set of classes and methods that serves these two main purposes:
- Allow signal processing and analysis using rapid and compact Python scripting, thanks to the functional programming paradigm proposed by this package
- Data acquisition with DAQ cards

The base classes defined by ```measpy``` are:
- ```Signal```: This is the core class of the package. It defines a signal through a sampling frequency, a physical unit and a list of samples and a description. Additional properties can be defined in order to take into account calibration or time shifting of the signal with respect to a reference time.
- ```Spectral```: This class represents the signals in the Fourier space. A spectral object contains the complex amplitudes as a 1D numpy array for frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency or the sampling frequency, and some properties as sampling frequency, unit and description.
- ```Measurement``` : A class that describe a data acquisition process, its outputs (Signal objects), its inputs (Signal objects)...
- ```Weighting``` : A weighting class holds complex values for a list of frequencies, and methods to to smoothing, interpolation, etc.

For now, data acquisition with these daq devices are implemented :
- Audio cards, via the ```sounddevice``` package,
- NI DAQ cards, via the ```nidaqmx``` package.
- Picoscope scopes, via the ```picosdk-python-wrappers``` package.
    
To import the package and perform data acquisition with sound cards:
```python
import measpy as mp
```
This will import the classes ```mp.Measurement```, ```mp.Signal```, ```mp.Spectral``` and ```mp.Weighting```.

To do data acquisition one has to select the module that corresponds to the target device. If it is a soundcard:
```python
from measpy.audio import audio_run_measurement
```
If it is a NI daq card:
```python
from measpy.ni import ni_run_measurement
```
If it is a Picoscope of the ps2000 series:
```python
from measpy.ps2000 import ps2000_run_measurement
```
If it is a Picoscope of the ps4000 series:
```python
from measpy.ps4000 import ps4000_run_measurement
```

In theses modules, there's also the ```audio_get_devices``` and ```ni_get_devices``` functions to get a list of devices present in the system. To get the list of devices, do for example:

```python
from measpy.audio import audio_get_devices
l = audio_get_devices()
print(l)
```

## TODO

Things to improve, implement, fix:
- A few scipy.signal functions are wrapped in measpy methods. New processing methods could be implemented (e.g. FIR...)
- Improve plotting methods
- Other In/Out synchronization methods (for now a method using a peak sync before measurement is implemented)
- hdf5 file format
- More documentation
- More testing scripts
- GUI ?

## Usage example

Consider the following experiment in which we want to record a pressure and an acceleration while we send a white noise at the sound card output (typical sound and vibration transfer function measurement):
- a white noise between 20Hz and 20kHz is sent to output 1 of the soundcard
- a pressure is acquired at input 1 (Unit pascals)
- an acceleration is acquired at input 2 (unit m/s^2)
- the sampling frequency is 44100Hz
- the calibration of signal conditionners are : 1V/pascal, 0.1V/(m/s^2)
- the soundcard input gain is such that for 5V at its inputs, the sample amplitude is 1.0 (input or output). This value is referred to as 0dB full scale (0dBFS)
- the duration of the measurement is 5s
- the soundcard name is 'My card', as given by measpy.audio.audio_get_devices()

To setup and run the measurement, do:
```python
import measpy as mp
from measpy.audio import audio_run_measurement
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

M1 = mp.Measurement(out_sig='noise',
                    out_map=[1],
                    out_name=['Out1'],
                    out_desc=['Output noise'],
                    out_sig_freqs=[20.0,20000.0]
                    in_map=[1,2],
                    in_name=['Press','Acc']
                    in_desc=['Pressure at point A','Acceleration at point B'],
                    in_cal=[1.0,0.1],
                    in_unit=['Pa','m/s**2'],
                    in_dbfs=[5.0,5.0],
                    out_dbfs=[5.0,]
                    dur=5,
                    in_device='My card',
                    out_device='My card')
audio_run_measurement(M1)
```

To plot the resulting data:
```python
M1.plot()
plt.show()
```
It is possible to save measurements in different formats. For instance, this saves the data as a pair of 'file.csv' + 'file.wav' files:
```
M1.to_csvwav('file')
```
The CSV file then contains the measurement properties while the WAV file contains the actual data that has been acquired (as many channel as the number of inputs+outputs involved in the measurement)

Load a measurement file into the Measurement object M2:
```python
M2=mp.Measurement.from_csvwav('file')
```
Other formats are possible : A pickle file, or a json+wave files. See from_pickle() or from_jsonwav() methods.

Compute transfer functions:
```python
sp = M1.tfe()
```
This computes the transfer function between the output signal and all the input signals as a dict of ```Spectral``` objects. The method that is actually used depends on the output type, as specified in the out_sig property of the measurement object. If a 'noise' or '*wav' type signal is sent, Welch's method is used. If a 'logsweep' type is used, Farina's method is used. This basic helper function works only if there is a unique output.

In general is is preferable to work on individual signals. All the acquired and sent signals are stored into the data property. It is basically a dict of signals, the keys being set by the in_name and out_name arguments when measurement is called. If these optional argument where not specified, then the keys are named by default In1, In2, ... and Out1, Out2, ... 

For example, to plot only the measured pressure we can do:
```python
a=M1.data['Press'].plot()
```
If no arguments are given, the ```plot``` method of signal objects creates a new figure, draw the signal with the correct dimension and put the correct labels on all axes. This methods returns an axes object that can be used later to plot new signals on the same figure.

One may want to calculate the power spectral density of the pressure (Welch's method on 2**12 points, 50% overlaping):
```python
PressPSD = M1.data['Press'].psd(nperseg=2**12)
```

```PressPSD``` is now a ```Spectral``` class object. It has its own methods. For instance, to plot the data:
```python
PressPSD.plot()
```

You might want to compute the transfer function between ```M1.data['Acc']``` and ```M1.data['Press']```:
```python
tfap = M1.data['Acc'].tfe_welch(M1.data['Press'],nperseg=2**12)
```

And use this ```Spectral``` object to compute an impulse response:
```python
Gap = tfap.irfft()
```

This could be done in one step:
```python
Gap = M1.data['Acc'].tfe_welch(M1.data['Press'],nperseg=2**12).irfft()
```

To remove frequencies below 20Hz and above 20kHz before computing the impulse:
```python
Gap = M1.data['Acc'].tfe_welch(M1.data['Press'],nperseg=2**12).filterout([20,20000]).irfft()
```

Units are preserved during the operations:
```python
print(Gap.unit)
```
should give something like pascal * second**2 / m

Individual signals can also be saved as a pair of files: a .csv containing the metadata informations of the signal (sampling frequency, calibration informations, name...), and a .wav file, containing the actual data (dimensionless):
```python
M1.data['Press'].to_csvwav('Pressure')
```
This will create Pressure.csv and Pressure.wav, that can be reloaded later with:
```python
press_sig = mp.Signal.from_csvwav('Pressure')
```
